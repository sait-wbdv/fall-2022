## Cool Videos Tony Found
- [Vite 2.0 Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQQ3CR2JTX8)
    - Vite is the bundler/web server that runs under Nuxt and VueJS but it can also run React, Svelte and vanilla JS websites. Try adding Vite to your vanilla project for extra nerd points.
- [TypeScript Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwuLxPH8IDs)
    - Typescript is a superset of Javascript. Watch the beginning of this video to find out what that means.
    - Typescript is very popular in industry and would be a great skill to learn and show-off in your final project.
