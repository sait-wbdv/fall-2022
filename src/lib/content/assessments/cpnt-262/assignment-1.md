In this assignment, you will be creating a column of body text with HTML and CSS. The content should be original. While you can use open-source content as inspiration, it should be unique and on-topic.

## Content Topic
Your button may cover any topic of your choice and does not have to relate to a real-life scenario. 

For example, you may write:
- your own bio for your portfolio website;
- a fictional (very) short story;
- a how-to article on your favourite hobby;
- a review of a book/movie/article/hiking trail;
- an About page for a hypothetical client website;
- a entry for your coding journal.

The content should make sense and be of potential value to the (hypothetical) reader.

## Instructions and Rubric

3. Place your content in a validated HTML file named `index.html` (CSS may be embedded in a `style` element in the `head` of `index.html`).
