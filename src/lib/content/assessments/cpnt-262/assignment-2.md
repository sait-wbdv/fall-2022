title: Assignment 2 - If This, Then That (forms)
type: assignment
points: 5
---

In this assignment, you create a form that dynamically changes some aspect of the page.

While you can use open-source content as inspiration, it should be unique and on-topic.

## Content Topic
The goal of this assignment is to use HTML form elements to trigger dynamic changes to its page using Javascript.

For example, you may create:
- a drop down menu that highlights different page content depending on the menu selection;
- a radio button list that changes the page's colour scheme;
- a checkbox that shows/hides a page element/content;
- etc.

The content should make sense and be of potential value to the (hypothetical) reader.

**Note: the page can contain other content that does not distract from the assignment requirements.** Feel free to re-purpose past assignments or projects.
