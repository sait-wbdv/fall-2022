## Javascript Warmups: Functions (20 min + 10min debrief)

- [Activity Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions)
  - Create functions that make conditional logic reusable

### Debrief Questions

- What kind of use cases could you use this logic on a web page? (_each group will need to discuss at least 1 of their solutions_)
- What are your preferences for syntax style? and why?

## Vue Directives

Vue Directives are used to render and manipulate data on a page. The most common is the [v-bind](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-bind) which we discussed yesterday.

### V-bind and Attributes

- Render text from JS using double moustach syntax `{{ variableName }}`
- Pass JS variables to attributes using `v-bind:` or `:`. ex: `<img :src="varName.src" :alt="varName.alt" />`
- Bind [css styles](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features.html#v-bind-in-css)
  - See an example using functions [here](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/f22-vue-content)
- pass props to components (what we will do after lunch)

### Activity: Bind Two Attributes

- Bind an image's src and alt tags to an an object
  - example object: `const image = {url: 'https://imageurl.com', alt: 'this is some text'}`
- Bind a class to styles declared in a variable
  - example variable: `const textStyle = 'text-2xl text-red-200'`
  - _if the first example is comfortable, try using a conditional to determine the styles of a variable_

### Event Directive

- [v-on](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-on) for handling events and functions (use this for things like your hamburger menu)

## Event Handling

- [Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/event-handling.html)
- [v-on gist](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/74543137780c1958f01e9b470a3cb13b) with notes on how to use `v-on`
- `v-on` is used to listen to DOM events and trigger a javascript handler (often a function)
- syntax: `v-on:click="handler"`
  - or shortened as`@click="handler`
- Use this for any buttons on a page
  - set the handler to be a function
- This can be used with the [`ref()`](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html) to make variables more reactive

### Event Modifiers

- To stop a form from being submitted when using a `<button>`, or to stop other default behaviour, use `.prevent`
  - `@click.prevent="myFunction`
  - Check out the other event modifiers
    - `@click.once` - will only trigger once
    - `@click.passive` - great for touch events
  - Key modifiers allow for effecting how an event handler is triggered
  - You can specify specific keys using key aliases and key modifiers

#### Creating Switches

- To make reactive switches, you'll want to use the following syntax
- `let variable = reactive({val: false})`
  - this will make a reactive variable that response to v-on well
- `const variableSwitch = () => variable.val = !variable.val`
  - this will create a switch that changes the variable to false
- `<button @click.prevent="variableSwitch">Click me</button>`
  - note that this doesn't need to be a button

## Setting up Eslint and Prettier with Vue and Tailwind

- [Ashlyn's Utils branch](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/f22-vue-content/tree/utils)
  - This branch has tips in the readme plus functioning code examples (will be merged to main after class)

## Lab Time

- [Vue Tutorial](https://vuejs.org/tutorial/#step-1): Structured 15 step set of activities
- Create new "views" and add them to the router [docs](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- Create a number counter with v-on
- Make variables change color depending on the state of a switch that is controlled using v-on

## Homework

- Read [Components Basics](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html)
- Read [Reactivity Fundamentals](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html)
- Watch [Every new Vue Developer has made these mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wKivv-vvhU)
  - Programming with Erik has a lot of great Vue content
