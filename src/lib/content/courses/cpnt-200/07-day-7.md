## 1. Review: Content vs Template
- Template: The code of your website: HTML, CSS, JS
- Content: Content-types stored in your Strapi project

### Questions to ask
- **How often does it change?**
- **Do you want to auto-generate it?**
- **Does the client need to update it or add new ones?**
    - Yes: Put it in Strapi
    - No: Put it in your template (i.e. it's not a part of CPNT 200)
- Examples:
    - **Form fields**: Template
    - **Categories**: Content
        - Relation: if multiple Content-types use the same categories or if the Category has its own description or related Fields
        - Enumeration: if it's used for one Content-type and it's a simple word/phrase with no other information (i.e. blog status)
    - **Navigation**: Could go either way (but usually in Template)
        - Template: if the nav is static and does not change very often
        - Content: if the nav changes often or the client needs to update it themselves
    - **Hero images**: Could go either way
        - Template: if the image never changes
        - Content: if the image needs to be updated by the client or if it's part of a Content-type (i.e. Blog Post image)
