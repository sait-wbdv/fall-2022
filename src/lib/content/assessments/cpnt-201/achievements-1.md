## Achievements

### Resolve Multiple Merge Conflicts

Practice making and resolving more merge conflicts. Instead of resolving a single conflict in a merge resolve 5 conflicts across multiple merges (at least 2).

**Bonus point if the resolution was from a real conflict that you resolved properly**

#### Instructions

To receive marks you must:

1. Choose a repo for making merge conflicts
2. Create multiple conflicts in 2-3 merges following the instructions from class and assignment 3.
   - this can be done on your own or with a partner
3. Create a heading in your readme for merge conflicts and provide links as was done in assignment 3
4. Submit a link to your repo

### Merge work from a "development" branch into main

It is often good practice to open pull requests to move code to a main branch. You can do this in any project **that is not currently being marked**.

#### Instructions

1. Open up a new branch with `git checkout -b branch-name` and make changes to your code in it
2. Push the changes to the remote branch
3. Open a pull request and merge the code into your main branch
4. In the readme, add a heading labelling the achievement and add a link to the pull request

### Use git revert, git reset, and git rm

- [Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-revert)
- Remove a file with git rm
- Use git revert to undo changes
- Use git reset to undo changes
- Add a list with the commit history of the relevant changes
  - Bonus point if the changes are tracked in a Pull Request

### Do any of the above achievements with a partner

- Both of you will submit relevant information just like cpnt-201-a3.
- **You cannot do the same achievement twice**
